Me Gem is a game in which players, in alternating turns, state words each an anagram of the last, but for one added one letter.
E.g. Alice says "e", then Bob says "me", then Alice's "gem", Bob's "game", and Alice's "mages".
It's based on the "stealing" mechanic of [Anagrams/Snatch]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagrams_(game) ).

The program here helps one practise the skill used in Me Gem and Anagrams: given a word and some extra letters, rearrange them to another word.

To run: install [Hy]( https://hylang.org/ ), then
```sh
hy main.hy
```

The program finds anagrams by web requests to [Internet Anagram Server]( https://wordsmith.org/anagram/about.html ).
